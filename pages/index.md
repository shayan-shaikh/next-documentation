# Index
This is a documentation webpage which is made in Nextra for the sole purpose of documenting and keeping updates of projects which will be worked on.

## Basic structure
- Kuch bhi commit karna ho toh follow this format : 
- All files must end with `_.md_` or `_.mdx_`
- ALways create the same inside of `pages` folder.
- Example : `pages/file_name.md`
- Further if you want to make a section and under that more files follow the scheme : -
- `pages/foldername/file1.mdx`

- `pages/foldername/file2.mdx`
